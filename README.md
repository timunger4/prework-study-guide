A study guide for course pre-work
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

A prework study guide that demonstrates the basics of programming language, including HTML, CSS, GitHub, and Java. The motivation to build this project came from a desire to learn the tenements of coding and how it is implemented into a project in Visual Studio Code. By building it, I slowly discovered how each different language affects the overall structure, format, and interactivity of a webpage. The finished product serves as a starting point for an introduction into software development. I learned how small changes can have a ripple effect on the overall code, and the best way to solve problems is to parse through line by line to see where an inaccuracy was established.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to reference important learning points about Java, HTML, CSS, and GitHub. Structuring elements in CSS, terminal inputs for GitHub, and workflow explanation in Java are also referenced to underline foundational techniques in programming. In addition, Java adds another layer of interactivity with the Chrome extension of DevTools. This way, we can see the effect that our code is having on the display of the website.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
